## Overview ##

This codebase contains the logic for the BotSpotML portion of the Flowlytic system. Its
objective is to analyze uploaded .pcap files and produce labeled bidirectional flow
.csv files. These files are exposed via API endpoints on the server and are consumed by the
FlowGridViz portion of the system. Currently the server houses two models for identifying
botnet traffic in bidirectional flows. These models are used to label flows so users can see
and hopefully better understand the behavior of malicious botnet traffic.

## System Requirements ##

In order to run the server the following must be installed and available on the PATH:

1. Python 3.x - https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. pip - https://pypi.org/project/pip/
3. pipenv - https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
4. Java - https://openjdk.java.net/
5. libpcap-devel
6. wget
7. bash
8. git

NOTE: This server must be run on a Fedora based linux distribution system due to the requirement for yum in the 'bootstrapserver' script.

## Setup ##

In order to run the server clone this repository and run the following from the base of the repository.

```
./bootstrapserver
./runserver
```

In order to check the server you can either `tail -f` or `cat` the `server.log` file generated by the server.

Assuming the networking settings of the system allow inbound and outbound connections on port 5000 this should make the server available at http://<server_ip>:5000/

## Execution ##

In order to test out the server go to http://<server_ip>:5000/v1/upload and upload a .pcap file. Then use the API outlined in the README.md to view the results of the analysis.
